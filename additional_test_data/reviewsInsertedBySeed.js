      "Doom is the most famous shooter in the history of computer entertainment, a game that, although it was not the first representative of the FPS genre, put it on a pedestal and set the bar high for all companies trying to compete in this field. In the near future, humanity has made significant progress in the conquest of space. colonize Mars and its two natural satellites: Phobos and Deimos. A military research facility was established on the surface of the Red Planet, which was to contribute to further successes in the exploration of the Solar System. The control over the facility is exercised by the UAC (Union Aerospace Corporation), which, on behalf of the army, also quietly pushes other top-secret projects. Given the great importance of the outpost, a large number of soldiers are stationed on Mars, able to quickly respond to any, even the most surprising threat. The player plays the role of a member of the space marines unit, who went to Mars as punishment. Months earlier, a soldier disobeyed an order to shoot civilians and attacked his superior. The officer was sent in a coffin to the base at Pearl Harbor, and you, as penance, to the Red Planet.",

      "Max Payne for PC, PS4, etc. is a third-person action thriller game. Remedy Entertainment, a studio from Finland, previously known mainly for the arcade racing game Death Rally from 1996, is responsible for creating the title. The original version of the game debuted in 2001 on PCs and sixth-generation consoles, and two years later, thanks to Mobius Entertainment, it received a greatly simplified conversion to the portable Game Boy Advance console. Eleven years after the premiere of the original, Max Payne Mobile, developed by the War Drum studio team, hit popular mobile devices, offering refreshed graphics, upgraded to HD standards. In the same year, as part of the PS2 Classics service, a digital re-edition of the original game from 2001 was made available to users of PlayStation 3 consoles. In spring 2016, Max Payne also went to PlayStation 4 owners, enriched with trophy support and graphics scaled to 1080p.",

    review_intro:
      "Control is a sci-fi third-person shooter. The player has to face the invasion of otherworldly forces, and in the fight against them he uses a number of special abilities and a telekinetic pistol, which, apart from shooting, allows you to throw objects and opponents at a distance.",
    review_body:
      "Control is a third-person action game in the vein of the X-Files series or Alan Wake games. The production was developed by employees of the Remedy studio, which has titles such as Quantum Break, the first two installments of the Max Payne series, or the aforementioned series. The players assume the role of a woman named Jesse Faden, who, wanting to deal with matters from her past, goes to a secret agency located in New York called the Federal Bureau of Control. When he visits her headquarters, a large concrete skyscraper known as the Oldest House, the place becomes the target of an invasion of otherworldly powers. Under unclear circumstances, the director of the agency dies, and as a result of strange rituals governing the activities of the Federal Bureau of Control, Jesse takes over this function. Thus, it falls on its shoulders to neutralize the aggressors. Control is a shooter in which we observe the action from a camera placed behind the heroine's back. The production, however, differs greatly from typical TPP shooters. Jesse is armed not only with a futuristic pistol, but also has special powers, including telekinesis, which allows us, for example, to throw objects at opponents or levitation, thanks to which we can reach hard-to-reach places. Thanks to Jesse's powers, the gameplay in Control focuses on dynamic combat, during which we also use a number of special abilities, customizable equipment and an interactive environment. Locations inspired by the architectural style known as brutalism add to the unusual and disturbing atmosphere of the game. Their shapes are changing and most often it happens before our eyes, providing a very surreal experience. This also affects the gameplay, as the level maps are not fixed, and the interior of the Oldest House is much larger than its size from the outside suggests. The structure of Control resembles a metroidvania game, as the player is given a lot of freedom to explore and often has to return to previously visited places to reach previously inaccessible locations thanks to new abilities.",

    review_intro:
      "An action-adventure game set in science fiction standards with an element of survival from the Dutch studio KeokeN. The story of Deliver Us the Moon takes us back to 2069, when man becomes capable of depleting natural resources.",
    review_body:
      "Deliver Us the Moon is a science-fiction first-person action adventure game with elements of survival. The game is the first project to be attached in 2013 by independent Dutch studio KeokeN, and its support was funded with funds raised through Kickstarter. The plot takes us to the not too distant future - to the year 2069, in which human civilization becomes exhausted at any time, the natural resources of the planet. To solve this problem, the governments of the most influential countries establish the Worldwide Space Agency (WSA for short), which allows external funds to be obtained to place exploration works on the lunar surface in the past. In the game, we play the role of one of the WSA astronauts who went to the moon with a mission to save humanity, travels through an abandoned base and research complexes. In the course of the game, however, our protagonist discovers the source of the conspiracy, which sheds a completely new light on the current stage on Earth. The action of the game was presented in the first or third person view (to choose from), and itself joined the possibility of displaying a large, open world on the surface of the moon for exploration. During our wanderings and the duty of riddles, pushing the plot of the game forward, we are accompanied by a minimal flying robot ASE (All-Seeing Eye). Thanks to his help, we can, for example, get through a series of common zones and face many of the dangers we encounter. The hero also has a star vehicle at his disposal, thanks to which exploration becomes a bit easier, and a backpack, with the help of which we can get to many seemingly inaccessible places. Survival elements have also been woven into this typically adventure game. During our analysis, we come to the locations obtained as a result, and our main task becomes managing the management of its supplies. Known from the factors of sandbox survival simulators, the crafting system has been established here as one, universal, specific, defined for the environment of our astronautics. Thanks to the invention of a new technology, in the performance improvement configuration, we can modify its appearance and execution, and then introduce the appropriate action with the encountered symptoms.",

      "Plot\n" +
      "      Morrowind takes us to the volcanic island of Vvardenfell in the title Morrowind, which is one of the provinces of the Tamriel empire. The ruling triumvirate of immortal divine beings is fighting an unequal battle with its recent ally - Dagoth Ure - who has not only become immortal himself, but also intends to expel the imperial troops from here, using his followers (the so-called Sixth House) and a disease he created known as as a corruption. The character we play is a former prisoner pardoned on the orders of the emperor himself - Uriel Septim VII. Although initially nothing indicates it, it is to leave a lasting mark on the fate of both the island itself and the entire empire.\n" +

      "      Gameplay\n" +
      "      In TES 3: Morrowind, we can observe the action from the eyes (FPP) or from behind the character's back (TPP). We start the game with a short conversation with another prisoner and leave the ship on which we arrived in Vvardenfell. Next, we have conversations with imperial officials. By answering their questions, we create our character by giving her a name, deciding on her gender, race, appearance, class (which we can choose from a list or create ourselves) and the sign she was born under. The choices made at this stage are important because they affect her stats and skills. Then the game world is open to us.\n" +
      "      \n" +
      "      Vvardenfell is vast. We will find there not only cities (Balmora, Vivec, Ald'ruhn, Ebonheart) and small settlements (such as Ashland camps or villages like the port of Seyda Neen, where our adventure begins), but also various mines and caves, fortresses and forts, and also all sorts of ruins, where you can come across both valuable items and numerous dangers. The driving force of the game are quests that push the story forward, accompanied by an abundance of side missions; the latter are made for both ordinary inhabitants of Vvardenfell and for guilds (whose ranks we can join and gradually climb the career ladder) and other groups.\n" +
      "      \n" +
      "      Exploration and execution of orders are often hindered by opponents, among whom we will find both hostile people and representatives of other races, as well as all kinds of monsters and machines left by the ancient civilization of the Dwemer. The clashes take place in real time, and we eliminate enemies by using melee and ranged weapons, as well as various spells. We develop our character's individual skills by simply using them or taking lessons from teachers; this applies to both the use of weapons (divided into their individual types) and magic (as above), as well as more prosaic things like running speed (athletics) or the height and distance of jumps (acrobatics). After developing ten abilities, our character will advance to the next level of experience, which in turn gives us the opportunity to develop statistics. In addition, we develop the hero's combat potential by acquiring better and better equipment; new items are found or purchased from traders. In addition, one of the abilities available in the game is alchemy, thanks to which we can create various types of potions.\n" +

      "      In 2002, the visuals of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind could be enjoyed; the realistically animated water was especially impressive. Although the game has clearly aged, today it attracts attention mainly due to its unique atmosphere. The climatic soundtrack, signed by the famous Jeremy Soule, has stood the test of time perfectly.",
