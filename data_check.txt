          1 |         1 | Graveman82 | Brings back memories. Best FPS of all times. Loads of action and fantastic atmosphere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2023-07-04 09:59:03.243
          2 |         1 | ToryTiller | First FPS I've ever played. That's what got me into competitive gaming career later in my life. Thank you ID Software!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2023-07-05 12:25:16.332
          3 |         3 | Witcheroo  | Mass Effect 1 was a colossal disappointment. The gameplay was a jumbled mess, and the controls were downright infuriating. The characters were forgettable, and the choices felt inconsequential. I regret even giving it a chance and would rate it a pitiful 3 out of 10.                                                                                                                                                                      | 2023-07-02 11:12:39
          4 |         3 | Graveman82 | Man, Mass Effect 1 was an absolute masterpiece! The depth of the storyline, the immersive universe, and the memorable characters had me hooked from start to finish. I'll never forget the epic moments, like facing off against Sovereign or making those tough choices that shaped the galaxy. And let's not forget the Mako driving! Sure, it was a bit wonky, but it added a unique exploration element to the game.                         | 2023-06-02 11:12:39
          5 |         3 | DarkFather | Mass Effect 1 was an amazing experience! The intricate storyline, rich world-building, and engaging characters kept me glued to the screen. The depth of choice and consequence made every decision feel impactful. I would easily rate it a solid 9 out of 10.                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2023-06-02 23:16:39
          6 |         4 | DarkFather | Duke Nukem 3D was an absolute blast! The over-the-top action, hilarious one-liners, and non-stop mayhem had me hooked from the get-go. The level design was top-notch, with intricate mazes and secret areas to discover. The variety of weapons and enemies kept the gameplay fresh and exciting. I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10, as it's a classic that still holds up today for those craving some old-school first-person shooter goodness. | 2023-05-29 21:16:39
